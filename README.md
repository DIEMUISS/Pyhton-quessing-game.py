This is a simple command-line number guessing game written in Python. The computer randomly selects a number between 0 and 100, and the player has 7 chances to guess it correctly.

🕹️ How to Play

The computer picks a random number between 0 and 100 (inclusive).

You have 7 attempts to guess the number.

After each guess, you'll be told:

If your guess is too high

If your guess is too low

Or if you guessed correctly

If you guess the number within 7 attempts, you win.

If you run out of attempts, you lose — and the correct number is revealed.
